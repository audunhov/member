# Member
Simple, yet flexible membership registration system for organisations.

## Features
The core system is intended to stay as small as possible to ease maintenance.
Our vision is most advanced behaviour being configured rather than hard-coded.

Two features are central in achieving this:
- Pub/Sub based event architechture 
- Lua engine for custom scripts

## Requirements
To access all features you will need:
- SMTP server for emailing
